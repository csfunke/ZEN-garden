        Summary:
            Limit shedding to demand, or to zero when shedding is disabled.

        Formulation:

        .. math::

            F^{shed}_{c,n,y,r}\\leq d_{c,n,y,r}

        The formulation applies over valid combinations of the declared indices.
        Empty or masked combinations are not constructed.

        Notation:
            Symbols and indices follow ``sets_params_constraints.rst``.

        Args:
            model_constructor: Object containing the optimization model.

        Returns:
            Constraint over its declared model indices.
