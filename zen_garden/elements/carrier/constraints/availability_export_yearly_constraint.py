        Summary:
            Limit annual exports to their carrier- and node-specific availability.

        Formulation:

        .. math::

            \\sum_rw_rF^{exp}_{c,n,y,r}\\leq a^{exp,annual}_{c,n,y}

        The formulation applies over valid combinations of the declared indices.
        Empty or masked combinations are not constructed.

        Notation:
            Symbols and indices follow ``sets_params_constraints.rst``.

        Args:
            model_constructor: Object containing the optimization model.

        Returns:
            Constraint over its declared model indices.
