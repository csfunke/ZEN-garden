        Summary:
            Map modeled investment decisions to their commissioning years.

        Formulation:

            \\sum_{v\\in\\mathcal Y:v+\\tau_h^{construction}=y}K^{investment}_{h,q,p,v}

        The formulation applies over valid combinations of the declared indices.
        Empty or masked combinations are not constructed.

        Notation:
            Symbols and indices follow ``sets_params_constraints.rst``.

        Args:
            model_constructor: Object containing the optimization model.

        Returns:
            Expression over its declared model indices.
